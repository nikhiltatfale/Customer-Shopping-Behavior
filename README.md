📊 Data Analytics Project
🔍 Overview

This project showcases a complete data analytics workflow, starting from working with raw data to generating meaningful business insights. The main goal was to understand patterns hidden in the data and present them in a simple and visually appealing way using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The project reflects how data can be transformed into valuable insights that help businesses make smarter decisions.

📁 Dataset

The dataset was imported and analyzed using Python in Google Colab. It contains structured information that helped in understanding trends, customer behavior, and relationships between different variables.
